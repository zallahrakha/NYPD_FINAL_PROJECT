About Data
List of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year.

This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity. Please refer to NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) - CKAN for additional information about this dataset.
